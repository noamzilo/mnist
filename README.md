# KNN
Calculate the performance of the KNN classifier, for k=1..10.

# PCA
* Calculate PCA on MNIST.
* Draw the average digit, and the 6 first principal components.
* Draw a graph of the explained variance, by n most significant components.
* How many components are required to get to 95% variance? 80%?
* Project the digits to dimension 2, and draw the obtained vectors, each digit with its own color.
* Repeat the KNN question, where each digit is represented by its projection to dimension 2, 10, 20.
* For some digit, project it to dimension k, then restore it. Draw the restoration for different k.
* Calculate PCA for every digit separately. Present the 1st 6 principal components of each.
* Calculate the projection of each test set image to each model.
* Restore by each model.
* Calculate the distance from each restoration to the original image.
* Select the model for which the distance is smallest.
